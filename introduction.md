Introduction
==================

Spacial is Special

or the Geographic data problem

You have to deal with data that has special rules.

Rules based on a reality not told in schools

Earth is not a sphere
========================================================================

You have been told that the Earth is a sphere

![Tipical representation of the Earth as sphere](img/sphere.jpg)

If you are lucky you have heard the history that tells that the Earth has [the shape of an Orange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Geodesic_Mission#Background)

![It's true, an orange as opposed to a lemon](img/orange.jpg)

---

But the Earth has the shape of a potato

Belive me, I know what I'm talking about

---

This is what we call a **Geoid**

(The scale is exagerated)

---

Although its the true shape of the Earth, we canno't measure over it.

![No measure is possible](img/nomeasure.jpg)

It's not a mathematic figure, we need a continuous surface.

(The scale is exagerated)

---

We need an **Ellipsoid**

![Image of an ellipsoid](img/ellipsoid.jpg)

(The first concept to remember)

But we call it the **DATUM**

(Why we call an Ellipsoid the Datum takes several courses of Geodesy, trust me on this)

Remember

> The **GEO** information lays over something *mathematical* that has its own rules.
>
> **THE DATUM**


Maps are flat (projections)
====================================

Geodata types (raster and vector)
====================================

OGC Simple Feature Acess data model
====================================

lon/lat versus lat/lon
====================================
